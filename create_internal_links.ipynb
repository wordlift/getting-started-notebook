    "Create dynamic Internal Links for your website by leveraging the semantic data in your graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ℹ️ **Info**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Internal links are hyperlinks that connect one page of a website to another page on the same domain. They facilitate user navigation, establish the site's information hierarchy, and distribute link equity across pages, thereby enhancing SEO performance. By constructing a semantic graph—a network that illustrates the relationships between various pages and topics—websites can create more meaningful internal links, aiding search engines in comprehending content relevance and context, which can lead to improved indexing and higher search rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is going to query the website's graph and create internal links for each web page. The results are written back to the graph by using the `seovoc:LinkGroup`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second notebook of a series: head to the first episode to [create your graph first in less than 5 minutes](getting_started_notebook.ipynb).\n",
